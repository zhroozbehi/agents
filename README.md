# Fashion Semantic Search Project

## üßµ Introduction

This project explores **building a semantic search and retrieval-augmented QA system** on a collection of fashion-related PDF documents using Databricks.  
The goal: **quickly find the most relevant passages and answer complex questions from diverse documents, even if wording or format varies.**

### **Why?**
- Traditional keyword search often fails when users don‚Äôt know exact phrases or when answers are scattered across large/unstructured documents.
- Semantic (vector-based) search leverages machine learning to find *meaning*, not just matching words‚Äîunlocking new workflows for research, discovery, and automation.

## üö¶ Project Plan & Workflow

1. **Read & Ingest**  
   Load PDF documents (fashion industry, sustainability, transparency, etc.) into Spark DataFrames.

2. **Chunking**  
   Split long texts into smaller, overlapping chunks for better semantic granularity and recall.

3. **Embedding**  
   Use a transformer-based model (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert each chunk into a high-dimensional embedding vector.

4. **(Optional: OpenAI Attempt)**  
   Attempted to use OpenAI embeddings (documented in case of future troubleshooting).

5. **Vector Indexing**  
   Create a vector index (using Databricks Vector Search) on the embeddings, enabling fast semantic similarity search.

6. **Semantic Search**  
   Query the index with user questions, returning the top relevant text chunks from the corpus.

7. **QA (Question Answering)**  
   Optionally, pass top results to an LLM for natural language answers grounded in the source material.

## üìù Notes

- **Platform:** Databricks with Unity Catalog and Vector Search enabled.
- **Flexibility:** All steps are modular‚Äîswap chunking or embedding models, adapt for new document types, etc.
- **Lessons Learned:** OpenAI embedding workflow was documented but not used due to API quota/plan limits.
